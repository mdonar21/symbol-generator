# Project Title



## Description

A symbol generator designed for use by the United States Army War College.

Utilizes the [Mil Symbol Library from github](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol) to create symbols from NATO SIDC codes.

Currently, the generator only supports the ground units symbol set.

Code is set up for additions to it however
