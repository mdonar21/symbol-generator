/*
Redoes the list using categories for better organization

Codes are still defnied by the MIL-STD-2525 specification
S – Scheme (Warfighting)

F – Affiliation (Friendly)

G – Battle Dimension (Ground Unit)

P – Status (Present)

U – Function (Unit)

C – Unit Type (Infantry)

I – Additional Unit Descriptor (e.g., Mechanized / specific subtype)
However they are now spilted into a code section where the SIDC codes are defined and a name and category section for easier browsing and selection in the UI

All symbols have been tested to work with most options in the UI 
Remove any that do not work with the current rendering system
